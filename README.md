# Support-Vector-Regressor-in-R
The model describes the ML model SVR realized in R. It gives a buffer range to the model and the dataset for small error.
SVR gives us the flexibility to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the data
